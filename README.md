# GitHub Actions Node.js Reusable CICD Pipeline

This node application belongs to Andrew Evans and can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewevans0102/ms-starwars).

This repository is to act as a node application we can run through a GitHub Actions reusable Node.js pipeline. This end of the pipeline will be the caller to the callable reusable pipeline found at [Flash1212/github-actions](https://github.com/Flash1212/github-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs.yml)

It will install/build/test. It's intended as an example of how GitHub Actions reusable pipelines can be used for CICD.
